# Fundamentals of Backend Engineering: Hands-On Curriculum

Welcome to **Backend Climb**! This is a free, open-source curriculum for engineers interested in levelling up their fundamental understanding of how computers work. The curriculum is also an opportunity to work on hand-on projects using **Rust** and **Elixir**. The goal is to encourage engineers not to just know _how_ something works, but _why_ it works that way. By dissecting fundamental concepts, the aim is to ensure that the learnings aren’t just surface-level but become a part of our foundational thinking. 

The material is designed to be approachable for individuals with diverse programming experiences. However, if you're completely new to programming, starting with an introductory book tailored for beginners would be more beneficial.

## Approach 

This course has been designed with the believe that the best engineers are those who know how to think clearly and thoroughfully about complex systems. They’re not satisfied with just knowing how to use a tool, they want to know how the tool works. By working on projects that engage you to think critically about the basics, you develop a kind of intuition that can’t be taught in a classroom or generated by AI. And that is the kind of mindset that will not only help build better software but will also set engineers apart in an ever-changing field.

Inspired by the [DiSSS](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/disss-learning) learning Methodhology, the goal is simple: take concepts that are usually hidden in dense textbooks or learned after years of trial and error, and break them down into practical, projects based modules. We’ve drawn inspiration from legends like Andrew Tannenbaum, Donald Knuth, and Linus Torvalds—people who’ve shaped how software works.

Every module includes **hand-on projects** and **reflection prompts** to help you step back, see the bigger picture, and understand how to adapt what you’ve learned to new problems. This course won't turn you into a Rust or Elixir specialist (although it will surely help you build a solid grasp of it!) - It’s more about making sure you can work with different language, any system, and build something great!

## Why this course where AI is everywhere? Isn't obsololete?
It’s tempting to think, “Why bother learning all this? I could just use AI.” And honestly, if your goal is to write boilerplate code, patch frameworks together, or lean on shortcuts, AI might be the better fit, indeed! But if you want to own, enjoy your craft, and evolve make progress in your work, then you are at the right place. 

AI is incredible for speeding up repetitive tasks, generating templates, or solving problems that are already well-defined. But what happens when you’re asked to debug a flaky system at scale, optimize an architecture under high load, or build something entirely new? AI won’t tell you how a thread scheduler works under the hood, why a distributed system fails in a specific way, or how to design a system that’s resilient to failure. That’s where engineers with strong fundamentals and the ability to think critically come in.

AI is raising the bar for what it means to be a competent engineer. Mid-level developers (never mind Juniors developers) who coast on surface-level knowledge will find themselves outpaced. But those who invest the time to master the core principles of backend development—who know how to deconstruct systems and make them better—will thrive in an AI-augmented world. If that’s the kind of engineer you want to be, this course is for you!
